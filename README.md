# AirQure

## Intelligent and Edge Computing based low latency and autonomous air quality system - AirQure

### Objective: 
To develop intelligent computational methods, tools, and techniques for the autonomous management of low-latency data fusion, forecasting, and analysis of air quality

### Sensor Data Fusion : 
Health Parameters: Age, Weight, Height, Gender, Existing health conditions Sensor Parameters: PM2.5, PM10, CO2, CO, SO2, NO2, Temp, Humidity

### Innovation: 
Personalised suggestions based on the forecasted values for each individual in the family Distributed deployment of the DL Model for low latency information exchange both on ProjectAIR and edge Community data fusion for improved spatio-temporal resolution of air quality data for societal level action plan and suggestions Intelligent autonomous forecasting technique for personalised suggestions and actuating the purifiers/humidifiers/HEPA filters/windows Easy Integration with Smart home system - Alexa/google

### Need/Applications: 
Existing AQMS do not take into consideration the existing conditions of the consumer Existing AQ network have very high latency - short term exposure of PM2.5 can be deadly for people with dangerous health conditions
